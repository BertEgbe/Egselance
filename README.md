                TheSweatSpace 
A workout space to carter to the needs of people interested in keeping up with their exercise routine. It's a place to train and stay fit, especially now when people are advised to seclude themselves indoors for days.
Considering that we're now in a global pandemic, where social distancing is required to fend off the spread of the virus, I had that in mind while proceeding to build this site. 

UX 
This site is for everyone. Exercise is for everyone's benefit which serves a purpose of maintaining good health and overall welbeing.
~ A first time user will be able to understand the site's purpose.
~ Logging onto the site for the first time, the services provided, how to contact us and opening hours are all there.
~ Any first time user, could be able to search our social media links for any feedback.
 
Design 
 ~ The main colors used in styling are taken from w3schools.com and Code Institute's white.
 ~ The Roboto font-family was used through the project, with referencing to Exo and a fallback of sans-serif in case for whatever reason those two couldn't be imported into the site.
 ~ The background image was taken from one of several Google images on fitness available for free download.

Features 
The site was designed particularly using Bootstrap4, HTML5 and CSS3.
~ The index.html, services.html, contact.html, and the contact.html all had components of Bootstrap in them.
~ The site response well on all devices and screen-sizes.
~ Google image was used for the background photo, references were made on www.w3schools.com especially on the different color display and Bootstrap4

Framework, Library
~ The responsiveness and styling of the website was due to the implementation of Bootstrap4.4.1 all across.
~ In the footer section of the page, all Social Media icons could hover and float transition because of Hover.css.
~ Google Fonts; Roboto, Exo; with a fallback of Sans-serif where used in the style.css throughout the project.
~ Throughout the styling and designing process, fonts from the Font Awesome website were also used.
~ Version control to commit on Git and push to GitHub. The project will be stored on the latter for any future references.

Testing 
~ A first time user can easily click on the services rendered at the site, with a select-menu button displayed on the screen.
~ The same goes for the contact page where the information on how to reach TheSweatSpace IS, and opening hours page shows the time the gym opens during weekdays. 
~ The site has been tested for bugs which there are a few but those concerns haven't been addressed yet. 
~ The project display nicely on all screen-sizes and has been tested on my PC to fit the entire screen.

Credits
~ To my mentor, Gerry Mcbride who guided me throughout this project and gave me hints on how to approach it using Bootstrap.
~ Working with my hackathon BI8 team during the weeklong exercise gave me pointers on how to target mine as well.
~ Bootstrap4 is the fundamental building block, w3schools.com showed me approach on several fronts, background photo was taken from Google.com, fontawesome provided all necessay fonts through the project, some inspiration was drawn from the "Basic-fit" website while building mine.
~ 
~ The tutor support team at Code Institute have been incredible helpful in pointing me toward the right direction and sorting out technical difficulties.
